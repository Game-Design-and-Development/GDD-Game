        2: vertical movement
            //note that the penguin currently falls slower than the default speed, its a little weird

move_speed:
    the number of pixels the block will move in one frame (tick), tell me if you need more precise movement

move_max:
    the number of frames that the block will travel in one direction before switching to the other direction

move_period:
    at what step in the process the block will start. you should probably choose either the value you entered for move_max or 0. other values will start the block in mid move and could be tricky to get where you want them to go.
